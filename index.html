            <h2>Trusted Platform Module (TPM)</h2>
            <p>A TPM is a specialized cryptographic processor that provides a hardware-based approach to security. It implements a standardized architecture defined by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) that ensures platform integrity and protects sensitive data through hardware-based mechanisms. The TPM creates and stores cryptographic keys that cannot be extracted, making it highly resistant to software-based attacks and malware.</p>

            <h2>Hardware Security Module (HSM)</h2>
            <p>HSMs are tamper-resistant hardware devices that provide the highest level of security for cryptographic operations. They are designed to meet stringent security certifications like FIPS 140-2 Level 3/4 and Common Criteria. HSMs utilize specialized hardware with features like tamper-detection circuits, encrypted memory, and self-destruction mechanisms if physical tampering is detected. They perform critical operations like key generation, digital signing, and encryption entirely within their secure boundary.</p>

            <h2>Secure Enclave</h2>
            <p>A Secure Enclave is an isolated security coprocessor that provides a trusted execution environment (TEE) within a main processor. It runs its own secure operating system, separate from the main OS, and includes encrypted memory and secure boot processes.
